# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

This project demonstrates a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins. It automates the build, testing, and deployment of applications, ensuring a seamless and efficient development workflow.

## Features

- Automated code integration from GitHub.
- Jenkins pipeline for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- Docker integration for containerized application deployment.
- Notifications on build success or failure.
- Easy rollback in case of deployment failures.

- **Jenkinsfile**: Contains the Jenkins pipeline script.
- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Docker image to be used for the application.
- **scripts/**: Shell scripts for building, testing, and deploying the application.

## Requirements

1. **Jenkins**: Installed on a server or local machine.
2. **Docker**: Installed on the Jenkins server for containerized deployment.
3. **GitHub Account**: A repository where the code is stored and integrated with Jenkins.

## Setup and Configuration

### Step 1: Jenkins Setup

1. Install Jenkins on your machine or server.
2. Install the necessary Jenkins plugins for GitHub integration, Docker, and pipeline support.
3. Configure a Jenkins job:
    - Link your GitHub repository.
    - Define the pipeline using the `Jenkinsfile`.

### Step 2: Docker Setup

1. Ensure Docker is installed on the Jenkins server.
2. Define the Docker image in the `Dockerfile` to be used for the application.

### Step 3: Pipeline Execution

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ebrahimabdelmonem1/CI-CD_Jenkins.git
    cd CI-CD_Jenkins
    ```

2. Define the Jenkins pipeline in the `Jenkinsfile`:
    - The pipeline will:
        1. Pull the latest code from GitHub.
        2. Build the application using the `build.sh` script.
        3. Test the application using the `test.sh` script.
        4. Deploy the application using the `deploy.sh` script in a Docker container.

3. Trigger the pipeline manually or through GitHub webhooks.

## Example Pipeline Stages

1. **Build Stage**:
    - Runs the `build.sh` script to compile or prepare the application.
    
2. **Test Stage**:
    - Runs the `test.sh` script to perform automated tests.

3. **Deploy Stage**:
    - Deploys the application using Docker by running the `deploy.sh` script.

## Clean-Up

To stop the Docker container or remove unused images after deployment, run:
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
docker rmi <image_id>
```
